```{r setup, include = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)
library(stargazer)
library(broom)
library(modelsummary)
library(here)
```

## Read in data
```{r}
homes <- read_csv(here("data", "slo_homes.csv"))

unique(homes$City) # use unique to see how many different cities there are in the dataset
```

A littel bit of cleaning:
Make a subset called homes_sub that only contains ovservations (rows) where the city is:
- San Luis Obispo
- Arroyo Grande
- Atascadero
-Santa Maria-Orcutt

```{r}
homes_sub <- homes %>%
  filter(City %in% c("San Luis Obispo", "Arroyo Grande", "Atascadero", "Santa Maria-Orcutt")) # %in% means: does the city column conatin any of these entries IN this vector

# use unique to confirm that you sorted the data to contain only 4 cities
unique(homes_sub$City)
```

## Lets do a little exploring of our data

Summary Statistics for home price based on city and sale status:

- Find and return in a summary table, the mean and std deveiation of home price grouped by city and sales status

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# to prevent code from running, set eval = FALSE

homes_sub %>%
  group_by(Status, City) %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_price = sd(Price, na.rm = TRUE))

# check summary table to see that it is broken up by city and status
# before modeling, look at how variables compare to eachother and if you see any trends
```

## Visualize data

Compare home prices to city
```{r}
ggplot(data = homes_sub, aes(x = Price)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = City, fill = City), alpha = 0.3) + # color and fill are within aes() because they are referring to a variable. Alpha is not referring to a variable, it is a constant. 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 3e6)) # to limit range on graph, use scale_x_continuous()
```
Explore teh relationship (visual data exploration) between square footage and home price. Change the point COLOR by City, and the point SHAPE by Status

```{r}
ggplot(data = homes_sub, aes(x = SqFt, y = Price))+
  geom_point(aes(color = City, shape = Status)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) # use to create linear model and place on graph

# when you have a point that seems to stray from prediction, think of possible missing variables that would explain the outlier
```

### Model the relationship with homne price as the dependent variable (outcome variable)

```{r}
# create saturated model (include very variable in the dataset)
homes_lm1 <- lm(Price ~ City + Bedrooms + Bathrooms + SqFt + PricePerSqFt + Status, data = homes_sub) # want to find relationship between price and the other variables **be concerned about colinearilty** (ex: Price, SqFt, and PricePerSqFt OR bedrooms, bathrooms, and SqFt kind of all tell you about the size of the house


# Make a subset that only contains the quantitative variables

homes_quant <- homes_sub %>%
  select(Price:PricePerSqFt)

# Use corrplot() to find correlations between different variables and plot them
homes_cor <- cor(homes_quant)
homes_cor
# see that there are a number of moderately or positively correlated values

# make correlation plot
corrplot(homes_cor, method = 'ellipse')

# Explore diagnostic plots of homes_lm1
plot(homes_lm1)

```

Try another model where we simplify based on concerns: 
Only include predictor variables for:
- City
- SqFt (think this is a good summary of bedrooms and bathrooms)
- Status

```{r}
homes_lm2 <- lm(Price ~ City + SqFt + Status, data = homes_sub)
  
plot(homes_lm2)

# Think about model fit, in console: look at summary statistics summary(homes_lm1) v summary(homes_lm2). 
#For homes_lm1 adjusted R^2 : 84% of the variance in price is explained by the predictor variables (city, bedroom, bathroom, price per square foot, sqft, status) Adjusted R^2 is used instead of multiple R^2 for multiple linear regression because it accounts for the fact that model fit will increase solely as an artifact of adding more variables
#homes_lm2 has adjusted R^2 of 54%. How do we balance the tradeoff of model fit and model complexity?? AIC!!!

# AIC provides us a comparison of balance between model fit and model complexity


```
Find the AIC value of each model:

```{r}
AIC(homes_lm1)
AIC(homes_lm2) 
# lower AIC indicate a better balance between model fit and complexity
# this is a huge gap between model1 and model2. Maybe neither model is good. Is there a different model that would work better than these two opitions?
```

Try another permuation of this model that you think might make sense, check out and compare the model fit, outputs, and AIC value.

```{r}
homes_lm3 <- lm(Price ~ Status + Bedrooms + Bathrooms + City, data = homes_sub)

summary(homes_lm3)

plot(homes_lm3)

AIC(homes_lm3)

```

To compare models side by side, use `modelsummary` ** can use on a single model or on multiple models ** IF you use 'modelsummary' to return model outputs of multiple models, it wants you to feed it to it as a list
```{r}
modelsummary(list(homes_lm1, homes_lm2, homes_lm3))

```
